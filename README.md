Created a react Todo List in which the user can create as many todo items during their day. The user will be able to edit, delete, and complete each item in their todos. What makes my application different is that it's has it's own clock/date posted on the top in which many apps don't include. My app also have a text saying either 'Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening" depending on what time it is. It will also print out your name. 

This app shows my knowledge of react using useState, useEffect, and useRef. It also shows that I have knowledge of installing features such as "react-icons". this app shows that I can be creative by adding additional features and conformable with css. I'm proud of this app because I worked hard on this and learn so many new things about react.
